= 🚆 Train Ticket Reservation System
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:icons: font
:sectnums:

A comprehensive mini-application built with **Go**, **gRPC**, and **PostgreSQL**. This project demonstrates a microservices-style architecture with a web-to-gRPC bridge.



== 🚀 Overview
This application allows users to manage train seat reservations through a clean web interface. To ensure compatibility with development environments (like those running Jenkins), the web interface is configured to run on a custom port.

=== Key Features
* *High Performance:* Uses gRPC for internal service communication.
* *Persistence:* Fully integrated with PostgreSQL to ensure data is not lost on restart.
* *Conflict-Free:* Web UI runs on port `8888` to avoid common `8080` conflicts.
* *Dockerized:* One-command deployment using Docker Compose.

== ⚙️ Setup & Installation

=== Prerequisites
* Docker Desktop installed and running.
* Go installed (optional, only for local development outside Docker).

=== 1. Quick Start with Docker
[source,bash]
----
# Navigate to the project root
cd ticket_booking_app

# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build
----

=== 2. Verification
Once the containers are healthy, access the following:

* **Web UI:** http://localhost:8888
* **gRPC Server:** localhost:50051 (Internal access)
* **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5432 (Internal access)

[NOTE]
====
If port `8888` is occupied, change the mapping in `docker-compose.yml` under the `web-ui` service.
====

== 📡 API Interface (gRPC)
The system supports the following core RPC methods:

`ReserveTicket`::
Creates a new reservation and generates a unique Ticket ID.
`ModifyTicket`::
Updates the section (A/B) or seat number for an existing Ticket ID.
`CancelTicket`::
Permanently removes a reservation from the database.

== 🛠️ Troubleshooting

.Port Conflicts
If you see `bind: address already in use`, it means port `8888` or `5432` is taken. Use `lsof -i :8888` to identify the process.

.Database Connection
The `grpc-server` waits for the `db` to be healthy before starting. If it fails, check the logs with `docker compose logs db`.
