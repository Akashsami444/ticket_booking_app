🚆 Train Ticket Reservation System

A mini-app built with Go, gRPC, and PostgreSQL. It features a modern microservices architecture with a web bridge allowing users to book, modify, and cancel train tickets through a browser.

🚀 Features
gRPC API: High-performance communication between the web server and the backend.

Web Dashboard: Accessible on port 8888 (to avoid Jenkins/8080 conflicts).

Persistence: PostgreSQL database stores all reservations.

Containerized: Fully Dockerized for easy deployment.

CRUD Operations: Create (Book), Read (View), Update (Modify), and Delete (Cancel) tickets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Go (Golang)

Communication: gRPC & Protocol Buffers

Database: PostgreSQL 15

Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

Frontend: HTML5 / CSS3

⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. Prerequisites
Docker & Docker Desktop installed.

Go 1.21+ (if running locally).

2. Run with Docker (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to start the entire stack.


# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd ticket_booking_app

# Start the application
docker compose up --build



Once the logs show the services are ready, open your browser at: 👉 http://localhost:8888

3. Running Locally (Development)
If you want to run the code without Docker, ensure you have a PostgreSQL instance running and set the DATABASE_URL environment variable.


# Get dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run Server
go run server/main.go

# Run Web UI (in another terminal)
go run web/main.go


📡 API Endpoints (gRPC)
The gRPC server listens on :50051 and supports:

ReserveTicket: Creates a new booking.

ModifyTicket: Changes seat/section for an existing ticket ID.

CancelTicket: Removes a ticket from the database.

📝 Usage Notes
Port 8888: The Web UI is mapped to 8888 to prevent conflicts with Jenkins or other local services.

Database: Data is persisted in a Docker volume named postgres_data. Even if you stop the containers, your tickets remain safe.
